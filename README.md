### 🧩 Current Projects

"Something Lost" 

An interactive psychological thriller game in visual novel format.
This project aims to push the known limits of what a visual novel is and can be.

While already built on a rich and compelling story that offers inexplicable 
mystery and gut-wrenching twists, *Something Lost* looks to expand the current 
boundaries of the genre by providing players with opportunities for deep exploration, 
clue gathering, puzzle solving and the experience of true player agency and decision making.

Players who see beyond the surface level will be rewarded for their curiosity in ways that were 
designed to offer a more satisfying and fulfilling game playing experience, while enriching the 
depth and affecting the direction of the story as a direct result of the player's willingness and 
ability to interact with and manipulate the game in creative ways.

Uncover burried clues to gain a glimpse into past events, reveal hidden evidence of what the 
story *doesn't* tell you. With every truth and secret discovered, comes a chance to influence 
and impact the outcome in ways that may surprise you. 

Curiosity may have killed the cat, but you aren't a cat.
*spspspspspsp* ..Are you?
